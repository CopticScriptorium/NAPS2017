# Coptic Dictionary Online

This tutorial will introduce you to the basic functionality of the [Coptic Dictionary Online](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary), created by the KELLIA project.  The KELLIA project is a collaboration between German and US researchers working in Coptic Digital Humanities, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. ([more information](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/about.cgi))

First simply type the search window a Coptic word (in utf-8/unicode Coptic characters).  You can control for dialect and part of speech (N=noun, V=Verb, etc.) or you can leave those options blank.

**Be sure to check out the search tips on [the Help page](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/coptic-dictionary/help.cgi).** Play around with searches for words containing particular suffixes, prefixes, or character strings.

You can even search translations.  Forget what the Coptic word for "river" is?  
  * Try typing "river" into the quick search bar on the top of the screen
  * Or go to the Dictionary home page and try typing "river" into the Translation box.
  * You can search translations in English, French, and German
  
Try searching for a word, such as ϣⲏⲣⲉ ("child, son").  
  * Click on the word ϣⲏⲣⲉ to see the entry
  * Click on the little plant icon.  This is the icon for the search tool for our digital corpus (ANNIS).  You will get the results for all the matching lemmas for ϣⲏⲣⲉ in our corpora.  Take a look.
