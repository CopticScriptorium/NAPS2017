# Digitize and Annotate a Text Using Coptic Scriptorium's GitDox Tool and Natural Language Processing Tools

In this tutorial, you will learn how to digitize and annotate a short Coptic text using our GitDox tool and NLP tools.  For participants in the NAPS workshop, we will provide a text and all the other necessary materials.  Check with the facilitators.  In groups of 2-4 people, you will transcribe a text and provide basic paleographic/manuscript encoding.


For more detailed documentation, visit our [wiki](http://wiki.copticscriptorium.org/doku.php?id=gitdox_workflow); some of this tutorial is taken from that documentation.

If you want to digitize a specific text for inclusion in the Coptic Scriptorium corpora and database, we would like to collaborate with you. Please contact us!

## Login and Orientation to GitDox

GitDox is an online XML and spreadsheet editor which uses [GitHub](github.com/CopticScriptorium/) for data storage and versioning. Coptic Scriptorium currently uses GitDox to transcribe texts and edit them in a spreadsheet.Although you don't need to have a GitHub account to use GitDox, it's helpful.  For the purposes of the NAPS workshop, you don't need one.  If you want to collaborate with us or use GitDox in the future, you can get an account later.

GitDox is located at https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gitdox/ .  Navigate there on your computer, and login using the username and password we provided you at the workshop.

When you log in to GitDox, you see a list of current documents. Use the dropdown menu above the list to display only documents from a certain corpus. You can also use the arrows to the right of each column name to sort by that column.

Documents are assigned to users (as noted in the fifth column). Please only edit documents assigned to you. If you believe a document should be assigned to you but isn't, please contact the person to whom it is currently assigned to confirm that you should be assigned the document before editing it.

The mode column lets you know whether the document is currently in transcription (</>) or spreadsheet (table icon) mode. 

Find the text we assigned to you in the workshop.  Click on the "Edit" button for your text.  Assign it to yourself.

## Saving and Committing

The transcription mode of GitDox has two options for saving work: save and commit. The save button saves changes within GitDox but does not commit those changes to GitHub. Your permission levels will not allow you to commit to GitHub; one of the workshop facilitators will complete this step of the process. Because GitDox depends on an internet connection, it's a good idea to save your work frequently while you're working using the save button.

## Adding metadata

Use the button at the bottom of the page to add metadata. Select metadata fields from the drop-down menu and enter the value. After you click submit, the metadata will appear in a chart on the bottom of the page. You can't edit metadata you've already submitted, but you can delete the entry from the list and re-enter the correct field and information.
