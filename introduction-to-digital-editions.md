# What are Digital Editions and Digitized Corpora?

What are digital editions and digitized text corpora?  This is a fundamental question for people who want to use them in research and people who want to create them for use in research. 

## Explore two digital corpora commonly used by scholars of antiquity and late antiquity

Spend 5 minutes exploring one of the following two digital corpora:
  * [Perseus Digital Library Greek and Roman Collection](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:Greco-Roman) (scroll down to Augustine or Basil for some early Christian texts)
  * [Papyri.info text navigator](http://papyri.info/search)
    * Try filtering using the metadata fields
    * Try changing your font to Coptic and typing in a Coptic word in the search box
    * Try changing your font back to American English and searching for a word in the translation.

As you are exploring, ask yourself:
  * What texts are here, what texts aren’t here -- what is the corpus?
  * What else besides “text” is in this corpus?  What other information can I find?
  * What kind of research could I/would I do with this text corpus?
  * Can I tell how the text has been digitized?

## Coptic SCRIPTORIUM Digital Editions

Our project publishes digital editions of literary Coptic texts.

Visit [data.copticscriptorium.org](http://data.copticscriptorium.org).  (Go directly to this link, or go to our main site at http://copticscriptorium.org and click on Corpora in the menu.)  This is our web-based repository designed for reading, browsing, retrieving digital editions of Coptic literary texts.  Use the menu to filter for texts.
  * Click on Corpus
  * Select a corpus, like the Apophthegmata Patrum
    * The "Normalized" button will give you a digital edition of the normalized text. 
    * The "Analytic" button will show you an edition of an aligned normalized text, English translation (when available), and part of speech tagging for each word.
    * The "Diplomatic" button will provide a digital edition of a diplomatic manuscript transcription
  * If you're looking at any of these digital editions, scroll down to see the document's _metadata_ (or information about the document).
  
Play around with the filtering and browse through the editions.  Consider::
  * Hover over the text with your cursor. Does anything pop up?
  * Can you click on anything?  What does it do?
  * What texts are here, what texts aren’t here -- what are the corpora?
  * What else besides “text” is in this corpus?  What other information can I find?
  * What kind of research could I/would I do with these text corpora?
  
If you want to cite a document, see the Citation information after each document's metadata.  Also, see our [Citation Guidelines](http://copticscriptorium.org/citation-guidelines.html) page.

All the editions you see are visualizations generated from text that has been encoded and annotated according to disciplinary standards.  The project releases digitized and annotated text in these formats:
  * Text Encoding Initiative Extensible Markup Language (TEI-XML) files
  * PAULA XML files
  * The online installation of the files in the search and visualization tool (or database) we use (called ANNIS)
  * The raw files used in the ANNIS installation (relANNIS files)

The following buttons will take you to those data files:

Perseus and Papyri.info also use TEI XML encoding for their digital editions.
